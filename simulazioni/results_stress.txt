Without slipstreaming  the  vehicle  loses  the  capability  of  handling  the  requested  velocities  after  12  laps,  while  havingslipstream ON all the race long leads to a longer race, 15 laps.  Altough this is just a qualitativelyresult, since is not actually possible to do all the race slipstreaming, from third simulation, as alreadysaid, can be seen that also slipstreaming for half of the time leads to increase in the performancessince 14 laps are possible.

What happens is that with slipstreaming, since aerodynamic forces are lower, to obtain the samevelocity  less  force  is  necessary.   This  force  reduction  leads  to  have  less  wear  and  thus  the  ellipsereduction is slower then when not slipstreaming.  For this reason higher velocities can be handledfor more time before the ellipse reaches the point in which such velocities become unfeasible.  To becomplete, as can be seen from previous figures, this point is around 15% of wear for rear tyre and8% for front tyre
